# In this file we explore some of the basic libraries in Python
import collections

### BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS ###

message = "Hello, nice to meet you"
numbers = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2]

# measures the length of a variable
length = len(message)

# sums elements of a list
sum = sum(numbers)

# organizes a list (by ascending order)
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

### OPERATING SYSTEM INTERFACES ###

import os

song = """
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
""" # a part of the song 'Photograph' by Ed Sheeran

# split a string in lines
lines = song.split(os.linesep)
print(lines)

# Pandas - data analysis
# ### Serie = 'column'
# ### DataFrame = 'table'

### TIME HANDLING ###

import time
import datetime

# gives you the current time in seconds
current_time = time.time()

# gives you the current date and time
# format YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS
current_datetime = datetime.datetime.now()

### MATH FUNCTIONS ###

import math

# square root
print(math.sqrt(4) == 2)

# exponentiation
print(math.pow(2,2) == 4)

### STATISTICS ###

import statistics

# mean
print(statistics.mean([2,4,4,6])==4)

# median
print(statistics.median([2,4,4,6])==4)

# mode
print(statistics.mode([2,4,4,6])==4)

### COLLECTIONS ###

from collections import Counter

elements = [1,2,3,4,5,6,2,4,6,4,4,4]

# Counter() returns a dictionary with the count of each elements of a list
# elements are keys, and their counts are values
counts = collections.Counter(elements)
print(counts)

### JSON encoding and decoding ###

import json

# json.dumps() converts an object to a JSON string
# the object can be a dictionary, a list, a tuple, a string, an integer...
# to convert an object to a file, you can use json.dump(object, final path)
json_counts = json.dumps(counts)
print(json_counts)

# json.loads() parse JSON string
# to load a JSON from a file, you can use json.load()
json_from_string = json.loads(json_counts)
print(json_from_string)

### REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ###

import re

# re.search() to look for a regular expression within a string

# Example 1: in daily life - searching for an email

email_text = """
Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. 
I am writing to express my interest in the Internship recently posted by your lab. 
I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics and have experience working 
with NGS data, Python, and statistical analysis.

Please find my CV attached. I would be happy to provide any additional information.

Best regards,
